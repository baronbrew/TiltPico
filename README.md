# RPi-Pico-W-iBeacon-Tilt-Scanner
 
## Initial Purpose

Tilt Pico is firmware for Raspberry Pi's Pico W that syncs with Baron Brew's Tilt 2 iOS and Android app as well as supports Small Brew Companion's (SBC) Tilt 4 Windows (T4W) PC app. The idea came up when Raspberry Pi's became difficult to purchase due to supply chain constraints and customer interest increased for a Windows PC app. Since Bluetooth 4.0+ / BLE doesn't work well with early versions of Windows, i.e. Windows 7 and 8, the Tilt Pico could potentially enable that functionality, similar to Tilt Pi / Raspberry Pi 3 or 4, though for a lower cost.

## HTTP GET commands for configuring Tilt Pico

In it's basic form, the Tilt Pico runs a web server, serving a list of Tilt hydrometers as JSON objects. The key : value pairs are compatible with with the Tilt Pi allowing compatibility with T4W and potentially other software.

# List of Commands (query string)

Note: The Tilt Pico will use mDNS to assist with finding the Tilt Pico on the network. The default name is "tiltpico" and additional name's are tiltpico-02, tiltpico-03, tiltpico-04, etc.

Note: Since the Tilt 2 app can't scan for mac address, (iOS and library limitation), the Tilt Pico will default to the closes Tilt with specified UUID/color.

Set configuration example: http://tiltpico:1880/set?mac=closest&color=ORANGE&Beer=Kegerator%20Temperature%2C84884&actualSGPoints=1.0000%2C1.0125%2C1.0642%2C1.1200&unCalSGPoints=0.9980%2C1.0121%2C1.0653%2C1.1171&actualTempPoints=31.5%2C67.1&unCalTempPoints=32.0%2C68.3&Timepoint=45032.57079114584&timeStamp=1681677716355&tempunits=%C2%B0F&fermunits=
